        <h2>All Heros</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Barbarian</h3>
            <p>The Barbarian is a single-target melee troop. He is the first troop unlocked in the Barracks. He appears as a male kilt-clad warrior with an angry, battle-ready expression, hungry for destruction. He has close-cropped blond hair and a long,
                yellow horseshoe mustache. In battle, he wields a sword which he uses to attack. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Archer</h3>
            <p>The Archer is a single-target ranged troop unlocked with a level 2 Barracks. She is the first ranged troop unlocked in the Barracks, and the second overall troop unlocked in the game. The Archer is a female warrior with sharp eyes. She wears
                a short, light green dress, a hooded cape, a leather belt, and an attached small pouch. She has a quiver slung on her back, a gold short bow in her left hand, and a golden band on each of her upper arms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Giant</h3>
            <p>The Giant is the third troop unlocked in the Barracks. The Giantâ€™s first target is defenses, making them an ideal troop to deploy to get rid of defenses fast. However, due to their low attack damage they are better used in large groups. Giants
                prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Wall Breaker</h3>
            <p>The Wall Breaker is the fifth troop unlocked in the Barracks. As the name suggests, Wall Breakers favor going after Walls, dealing massive damage to them. The Wall Breaker attacks by locating the nearest protected (read: Wall enclosed) building
                and destroying its protective Walls, blowing itself up in the process. It deals splash damage around its target and deals 40x damage to Walls.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Balloon</h3>
            <p>Balloons are the sixth overall troop unlocked in the Barracks, and is the first aerial unit unlocked in the Home Village, requiring a level 6 Barracks. Balloons are "promoted" Wall Breakers that now attack from a hot air balloon. They drop
                bombs towards the ground with a large area splash damage,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Wizard</h3>
            <p>The Wizard is troop unlocked in the level 7 Barracks. He is a fragile ground unit with high splash damage and range. Wizards are commonly used in large groups for fire support or as a force multiplier (similar to Archers), but they can also
                be effective in smaller numbers, especially at lower levels. Wizards have no preferred target when attacking; they will simply attack the closest building. However, if they become aware of enemy Clan Castle troops, Heroes, or Skeleton</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Dragon</h3>
            <p>The Dragon is a troop unlocked at Barracks level 9, which requires Town Hall level 7. It is a fearsome flying unit capable of attacking both ground and air units, with both high health and damage. Similar to the Wizard, the Dragon's attacks
                are ranged and deal splash damage, observed when it attacks enemy troops that overlap or over walls.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Pekka</h3>
            <p>P.E.K.K.A is a big unit unlocked in the standard Barracks when it is upgraded to level 10 which requires Town Hall level 8. She is a slow single-target melee Elixir Troop that occupies a big amount of housing space but comes with large amounts
                of hitpoints and damage. She is one of the strongest melee troops in the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="empty">
            <img src="images/archh.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="card k-one">
            <h3>Miner</h3>
            <p>The Miner is the twelfth Elixir troop unlocked in the level 12 Barracks, which requires Town Hall level 10. The Miner is a single-target troop that burrows underground when not engaged with enemy troops or buildings. This allows him to have
                the useful ability of not being affected by walls and bypassing all traps, but can still receive effects from spells.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Electro Titan
            </h3>
            <p>The Electro Titan is an Elixir troop unlocked at Barracks level 16, which requires Town Hall 14. She is a ground troop with very high hitpoints and attacks both ground and air targets with a short-range whip attack. In addition, the aura around
                her causes all buildings (save for Walls) and troops near her to take constant damage per second.</p>
